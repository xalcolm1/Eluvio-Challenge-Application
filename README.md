To start the mock server
 1. clone this repo
 2. cd into the backend folder 
 3. run the following command in your terminal
 
    ```npm run server```
    
   your server should now be running on port 5000 and you can send a post request to api/pages with your id's as an array in the body
   
   or you can start a local server with the index.html file and input ids with the basic ui I built and see the pages open in a new tab.
